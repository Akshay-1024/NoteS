# Optimal Protocols for Studying and Learning

# Offsetting Forgetting

- The best way to study and learn is to access the components in my memory system that offset forgetting

# Periodic Testing

- Periodically stop and test yourself on what you learnt.
- Testing is a way of retention or offsetting forgetting

# Focus, Alertness, Sleep, Tools

- You need to be alert and focused in order to paying attention for the thing that you are trying to learn 
    - Great night sleep
    - limit external unwanted stress
    - Silent script with in head ( I need to learn this....) this is will ramp up focus do it must
        - This pulls the attention and focus out of you fully 
        - This straining releases epinepheres nuro modulators good for us.
    
# Tool: Improve Focus, Mindfullness meditation and Preception Exercise

- Be Well Hydrated

- 5 to 10 Min Mindfullness meditation -> bring attentions back to breathing -> increases focus and attention

# Sleep & Neuroplasticity tool: Non Sleep Deep REst (NSDR)

- The Strengthing and weaking of connection between the neurons do not occure at the time of focusing or attention they usually occure in deep sleep or sleep like states
    - During REM (Rapid Eye Movement) State

- The First Night Effect
    - Information you learn on a given day mostly consolidates during the night sleep that we have after the first night of the learning Occurs
    - This means the first night after learning you want to get the best sleep possible
    - Do your best to get your sleeps right

# Study habits of successful students

1) Set time to study 
2) Clear out all the distractions (isolateing themselves no disturbance at all)
3) Consistent time table 
4) Make an effort to teach to the peers  
5) Watch 1, Do 1, Teach 1
6) Do everything deliberatly then it will become voluntary

# Studying & Aspirations Goals; Challenging Material

- Motivation to keep up to read and focus came from having high level aspirations of what they can have once they done this learning process
    - Just high level of information
- if you love the material that you are learning the aspirational stuff may not be needed
- Studying thats challenging is the most effective to keep motivation the after effects of successfully doing it
- Effort is CornerStone of Studying.

# Tool: Testing as a Learning Tool

- states of sleep
- mindfullness meditation
- isolation
- limit distraction
- time table
- teach others

- Testing is the best way to retain knowledge or offset forgetting.
- Forcing to remember the material is the best way to never forget, testing the the best way to do it

# SelfTesting - Repeated Testing

- which is better?
    1) study, study, study, study ------ 3 
    2) study, study, study, tested ----- 2
    3) study, test, test, test  -------- 1
- More tests you take to the material you get more exposure. more retail less offset forgetting
- study and test is always better than read and reread

# New Material & Self testing timing

- Which is better?
    1) Study, immediate test, delay test (same time) ---------- 1
    2) study, delay test, delay test (same time) -------------- 2
    3) study, long long long delay test, test (same time) ----- 3
- Test your self on material you are exposed to as soon as you are exposed to this helps in offsetting forgetfullness

# Familiarity vs mastery

- Recognizing something is not the same as having mastery over that thing
- when you read something over and over its famialiarity not mastery
- when you get tested on material something happens in your nervous system to lock in the correct information
- you have to be familier with the material to have mastery

# Self-Testing and Offsetting Forgetting

- 50% 
- Testing on a material right after getting exposed to it allows us to get the best retention

# Best Type of of self tests; Phone and Post Learning Distractions

- Open ended, Short answer, very minimal prompt tests
- Multiple choice qns allow familiarity for the fact
- MCA with tricky qns where all options look similar
- If you are really serious about the material, take a few minutes and think about the material just after being exposed. and test yourself

# Tool: Gap Effects; Testing as Studying vs Evalution

- Take periodic pasues between learning of material for 5 to 30 seconds this will increase retention because hippocampus in brain can make more repetations of new material

# Little tip:
- After your focused bout of studying, note taking, and learning. Take those notes and paste them into chatgpt and ask it to give you a test with short open ended minimal prompt questions on the material. I did this with the material from this podcast and I'll never go back to flashcards and other time consuming ways of self testing. Thank you Andrew!
